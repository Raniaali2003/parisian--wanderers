          <h3>Luxurious Cafes</h3>
          <p>
            There has always been coffee in Paris but it’s only been within the
            last decade that there has been genuinely good coffee in Paris.
            That’s thanks to a robust specialty coffee movement that has turned
            the capital into a coffee lover’s dream. With local roasters and
            barista-led shops in nearly every arrondissement, Paris rivals all
            the best European destinations for espressos, pour-overs, flat
            whites, and crèmes. The aesthetics may vary from café to café but
            the selection of drinks will be familiar and served alongside
            delicious sweets. Here, find our recommendations for the best
            Parisian cafés and coffee shops to grab a cup.

              I would like to dedicate this tripadvisor evaluation to the city
              of Paris and its beautiful characteristics. There is only a few
              cities around the world that offer what I would describe as a
              generally amazing place. A written guide (booklet) can of course
              provide an insight to a city and highlight places which should be
              seen but simply walking around aimlessly in Paris and absorbing
              the vibe, the culture of the inhabitants, the language, the pride,
              etc...is something everyone should have done at least once in
              their life.
